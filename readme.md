  <h3 align="center">CytoBridge: A Toolkit for Single Cell Spatiotemporal Dynamical Generative Modeling</h3>

</div>

**CytoBridge** is a Python package designed to provide a unified and extensible framework for modeling cellular dynamics using Spatiotemporal Dynamical Generative Models. Our goal is to connect cutting-edge theoretical frameworks with practical, easy-to-use tools.

The core of CytoBridge is to model cellular processes by learning a dynamical model that accounts for various biological phenomena using time-series transcriptomics data (including both scRNA-seq and spatial data):

  * **Velocity**: The instantaneous direction of cell state transitions. (Corresponds to **Dynamical OT**)
  * **Growth**: The proliferation and apoptosis rates of cell populations. (Corresponds to **Unbalanced Optimal Transport, UOT**)
  * **Score**: (Planned) A diffusion or noise term, capturing the stochasticity in cell state. (Corresponds to **Regularized Unbalanced OT**)
  * **Interaction**: (Planned) A term to model cell-cell communication and its effect on dynamics (Corresponds to **Unbalanced Mean Field Schrödinger Bridge**).

The package is built to be modular, allowing users to easily combine these components to replicate existing models or create novel ones.

## Current Status

CytoBridge is currently under active development. The foundational framework is in place, and we have implemented the following models:

  * **Dynamical OT** (velocity)
  * **Unbalanced Dynamical OT** (velocity + growth)
  * **Regularized Unbalanced OT (RUOT)**  (velocity + growth + stochasticity)
  * **Conditional RegularizedOT Unbalanced  Flow Matching (CRUFM)**  (velocity + growth + stochasticity)
  * **CytoBridge**  (velocity + growth + stochasticity + interaction)

## Roadmap

We are continuously working to expand the capabilities of CytoBridge. Our development plan is as follows:

  - [x] **Phase 1: Stochastic Dynamics & RUOT**

    - [x] Implementation of the `score` component to model stochasticity.
    - [x] Support for training methods based on the **Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT)** frameworks.
    - [x] Integration of simulation-free training methods (e.g., Conditional Flow Matching, Velocity-growth Flow Matching).
    - [x] Basic plotting functions and downstream analysis.

  - [x] **Phase 2: Advanced Modeling & Downstream Analysis**
- [x] Implementation of the `interaction` component for modeling cell-cell communication.
  - [x] Advanced plotting functions and downstream analysis.


  - [ ] **Phase 3: Spatiotemporal Dynamics**

    - [ ] Support for time serise spatial transcriptomics data.
    - [ ] Advanced plotting functions and downstream analysis.
      Here’s a polished and reorganized version of your installation and usage instructions, with improved clarity and flow:

## Installation

CytoBridge is currently under active development. You can install it using the methods outlined below:

### Recommended Approach: Install via pip  

Install CytoBridge quickly and easily using pip:

```bash
pip install CytoBridge
```

### Developer Approach: Clone the Repository  

This approach is suitable for developers who want to modify the source code or contribute to the project:  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/CytoBridge.git
```

2. Set up a Conda environment to manage dependencies  
   Follow the steps below to create an isolated environment for CytoBridge:  

   (1) Create and activate a new Conda environment  

   ```bash
   conda create -n CytoBridge python=3.10 ipykernel -y
   conda activate CytoBridge
   ```

   (2) Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository  

   ```bash
   cd path_to_CytoBridge
   ```

   (3) Install all required dependencies  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Basic Usage

CytoBridge supports both **h5ad** and **csv** inputs.  
For a complete walk-through, see the web page : https://cytobridge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Folloing are two examples's training process:

---

### 1. Starting from an AnnData object (h5ad)

```python
import scanpy as sc
import cytobridge as cb
import anndata as ad

# 1. Pre-process
#    time_key: column in adata.obs that stores time-points
cb.pp.preprocess(adata,
                 time_key='Time point',
                 dim_reduction='PCA',
                 normalization=True,
                 log1p=True,
                 select_hvg=True)

# 2. Train
#    dynamical_ot : velocity only
#    unbalanced_ot: velocity + growth
#    ruot         : velocity + growth + score (stochasticity) (RUOT mode)
cb.tl.fit(adata, config='dynamical_ot', device='cuda')   # or 'cpu'

# 3. Save
adata.write_h5ad("results_with_model.h5ad")
```

---

### 2. Starting from a CSV file (gene-expression table)

```python
import pandas as pd
from anndata import AnnData
import cytobridge as cb

# 1. Load table: rows = cells, columns = gene counts + one "samples" (time) column
df = pd.read_csv('simulation_gene.csv')

# 2. Separate metadata and expression
obs = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
obs['samples'] = df['samples'].astype(str)          # time information
X = df.drop(columns=['samples']).values             # expression matrix

# 3. Build AnnData
adata = AnnData(X=X, obs=obs)

# 4. Pre-process (skip built-in PCA/norm here because data are already transformed)
cb.pp.preprocess(adata,
                 time_key='samples',
                 dim_reduction='none',
                 normalization=False,
                 log1p=False,
                 select_hvg=False)

# 5. Train
cb.tl.fit(adata, config='ruot', device='cuda')

# 6. Save
adata.write_h5ad("results_with_model.h5ad")
```

Both snippets return an `AnnData` object containing:

- trained model: `adata.uns['dynamic_model']`  
- latent velocity: `adata.obsm['velocity_latent']`  
- growth rates: `adata.obsm['growth_rate']` (when applicable)

## One `fit` entrypoint (recommended)

To keep the pipeline **AnnData-centered**, the recommended pattern is:

1) Use preprocessing/alignment to produce an aligned `AnnData` that contains:
   - `adata.obs['time_point_processed']` (numeric time)
   - `adata.obsm['X_latent']` (aligned + reduced features used for training)
2) Call **one** training entrypoint: `cb.tl.fit(adata, config=..., device=...)`.

`cb.tl.fit(...)` also accepts `.h5ad` / `.csv` paths as a convenience, but the canonical API is still `fit(AnnData, ...)`.

For spatial alignment, prefer the package-level atomic API:

```python
from CytoBridge.pp import AlignConfig, align_spatial

cfg = AlignConfig(n_pcs=50, spatial_dim=2)
adata_aligned = align_spatial(
    adata_or_h5ad="/path/to/raw.h5ad",
    time_key="time",
    cfg=cfg,
    output_csv="/path/to/aligned.csv",      # optional
    output_h5ad="/path/to/aligned.h5ad",    # optional
)
```

Project-level multi-step preprocessing (alignment + graph + edge predictor) is
kept in `scripts/preprocess_pipeline.py` rather than package API.
